Friday Project 7 for Dr. Clary's class Ds-3850
fp.1 
The code defines a function called mad_libs, which prompts the user for various inputs such as an adjective, plural nouns for large objects, a body part, a restaurant name, and types of food. Each input is stored in a variable. After gathering all the necessary words, the function constructs a humorous story using an f-string that incorporates these inputs. The story is formatted with line breaks for readability. Finally, it prints an introductory message followed by the completed Mad Libs story. The function is then called to execute the entire process when the script runs.
