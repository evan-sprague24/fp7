Friday Project 7 for Dr. Clary's class Ds-3850
fp.1 
The code defines a function called mad_libs, which prompts the user for various inputs such as an adjective, plural nouns for large objects, a body part, a restaurant name, and types of food. Each input is stored in a variable. After gathering all the necessary words, the function constructs a humorous story using an f-string that incorporates these inputs. The story is formatted with line breaks for readability. Finally, it prints an introductory message followed by the completed Mad Libs story. The function is then called to execute the entire process when the script runs.
fp.2
The code begins by importing the random module, which provides functions for generating random numbers. It then defines a function called powerball_game that encapsulates the main logic of the program. Inside this function, a greeting message is printed to welcome the user and explain the program's purpose, indicating that it will generate six random Powerball numbers. Next, it generates the first five numbers by using random.sample to select five unique numbers from the range 1 to 69. The sixth number, representing the Powerball, is generated using random.randint, which randomly selects a number between 1 and 26. To enhance readability, the first five numbers are sorted in ascending order. The program then formats these numbers into a string, ensuring there is one space between the first five numbers and three spaces before the Powerball number. This formatted string is printed to display the generated Powerball numbers to the user. Finally, the program concludes with a farewell message, thanking the user for using the generator. The function is then executed by calling powerball_game, triggering the entire process.
